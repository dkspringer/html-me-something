	  			<h1>My Favorite Teams</h1>
			    <p>A big part of my life is following my sports teams, sometimes obsessively.  I enjoy not only watching my teams on TV, but also traveling across the country to see them play.</p>

			    <h2>Colorado Rockies</h2>
			    <p>My favorite sport is baseball.  I began playing tee ball in kindergarten and soon transitioned to baseball, which I played through high school.  Like many kids that play a sport, I looked up to the major league players and teams.  For me, my favorite team was the Colorado Rockies, whom I first saw play in 1994, their second season in the league.</p>
			    <p>Growing up, although my family and I had moved to Pennsylvania from Colorado shortly after that first game, I continued to follow the Rockies.  I would eagerly look at the schedule every year to see when they would be playing in Philadelphia, and my dad would often pull me out of school early to go to a game.  When I went to college in 2007 in Colorado, I began to follow the team even more closely, going to upwards of 20 games at Coors Field every year.</p>
			    <p>Now that I once again have moved away from Colorado, I watch most of the 162 games on TV.  Whenever the Rockies play in Washington, Baltimore, or Philadelphia, I always try to make it to every one of those games.  I even try to get to a few games when they play a little further away in New York or Pittsburgh.  Of course, I make at least one trip to Colorado every year to see them play at home, such as this year when I travelled to the Home Opener.</p>

			    <h2>Colorado Buffaloes</h2>
			    <p>As both my parents are University of Colorado alumni, I grew up rooting for the Buffs.  I especially have fond memories of watching the big CU-Nebraska game with my that was held on the day after Thanksgiving every year until both teams changed conferences in 2011. As a kid growing up in the 1990s, it was an exciting time to root for CU, as they were routinely in the Top 25.</p>
			    <p>Unfortunately, by the time I followed in my parents footsteps and went to University of Colorado, the football program was only a shadow of its former self.  Yet, now that I was a student there, they were my team, even more than they had been growing up.  My first two years of college, I participated in the marching band and played at every home game in 2007 and 2008, and we traveled to Arizona State and University of Kansas, as well as the 2007 Independence Bowl.</p>
			    <p>Just like with the Rockies, I continue to closely follow CU football out here on the East Coast.  A few years ago I connected with the University of Colorado Alumni Association of DC, and I attend watch parties for most of the games.  I also fly out to Colorado for at least one game a year.</p>

			    <h2>Denver Broncos</h2>
			    <p>While I don't follow the Broncos as closely as I do the other two teams, they are my favorite NFL team, and I usually watch most of their games on TV.  Last year I went to my first ever professional football game with my dad and brother when the Broncos played an away game against the Washington Redskins on Christmas Eve.  This year, when the Broncos played in Baltimore, I went to that game as well.  Hopefully in the future I will finally make it to a home game at Mile High Stadium.</p>
